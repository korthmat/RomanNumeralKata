Assumptions
-----------
- According to the problem description, "The symbols 'I', 'X', 'C', and 'M' can be repeated at most 3 times in a row."
  Because of this, the largest number that will convert is 3999 ("MMMCMXCIX") - 4000 would be "MMMM", which is not
  allowed.  (There ARE ways to represent larger numbers in Roman numerals, but not for the purposes of this problem!)
